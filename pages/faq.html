    <h2>What is the difference between a real estate agent and a broker?</h2>
    <p>Real estate agents are individuals who are licensed to facilitate real estate transactions in their state. A broker is someone who is licensed to own their own real estate firm. A broker is often more experienced and has taken education beyond the agent level as required by state laws and passed a broker’s license exam. Brokers are also more knowledgeable on real estate legal issues.</p>
    <h2>What is the first step of the home buying process?</h2>
    <p>The first step of the home buying process is getting pre-approved for a mortgage. A pre-approval letter from a lender is important for a few reasons. First, it’s important to know how much you can borrow. You’ll be able to search for homes that you know are within your budget. The loan estimate will also show how much of a down payment is required and closing costs. It will give you a clearer picture of what you need. Finally, a pre-approval shows that you are serious about buying. Many agents can not show a home without one. This is to protect the seller’s privacy and for safety reasons.</p>
    <h2>What is a seller’s market?</h2>
    <p>A seller’s market is where increasing demand for homes drives up prices. Some things that can drive up demand are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Economic factors</li>
        <li>Interest rates trending downward - make home buying more affordable</li>
    <li>A short-term spike in interest rates - may compel “on the fence” buyers to make a purchase if they believe the upward trend will continue.</li>
    <li>Low inventory - prices for existing homes may go up because there are fewer units available.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What is a Buyer’s Market?</h2>
    <p>A buyer’s market occurs when there are declining home prices and reduced demand. Several factors may affect long-term and short-term buyer demand, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Economic disruption</li>
        <li>Interest rates trending higher</li>
        <li>Short-term drop in interest rates – can give borrowers a temporary edge with more purchasing power.</li>
        <li>High inventory – new construction can create downward pressure on prices of older homes nearby, particularly if they lack highly desirable features. </li>
        <li>Natural disasters - a recent earthquake or flooding can lower property values.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What kind of credit score do I need to buy a home?</h2>
    <p>Most lenders require a FICO score of 620 or better. Borrowers with higher credit scores represent less risk to the lender, often resulting in a lower the down payment requirement and better interest rate. Buyers with lower credit scores may need to bring more money to the table (or accept a higher interest rate) to offset the lender’s risk.</p>
    <h2>Why should I hire a property manager?</h2>
    <p>Many property owners are concerned with the additional cost of hiring a property manager. In reality though, a good property manager can save you money. A property manager will relieve you of the expenses incurred from marketing your property, screening tenants, dealing with maintenance or repair issues, and handling tenant contracts and complaints. It will free up time and allow you to get back to your life and be worry-free.</p>
    <h2>Why do I need a commercial real estate broker?</h2>
    <p>A good tenant broker is much more than just a space finder; you should view your broker as you would your attorney or accountant. You want their advice about what space is best suited for your business and what lease terms you can expect to negotiate with the owner. A good broker will help you in all aspects of the commercial lease transaction. That help starts with understanding your business and ends with a signed lease.</p>
