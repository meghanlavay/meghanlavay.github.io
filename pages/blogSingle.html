             <h2>Home Buying and Selling During the Pandemic: What You Need to Know</h2>
             <div class="leftWrap">
                 <img src="../images/blogPandemic.jpg" alt="couple with face masks"/>
            </div>
             <p> Technology and good-old-fashioned creativity are helping agents, buyers, and sellers abide by COVID-19 health and safety practices while getting deals done.</p>
             <p>Some buyers are touring houses virtually. Others visit in person while remaining at least six feet from their agent. Sellers are hosting open houses on Facebook Live. Appraisers are doing drive-by valuations. Buyers are watching inspections via video call. Masked and gloved notaries are getting signatures on doorsteps.</p>
             <h2>Here’s what home buying and selling during the pandemic looks like:</h2>
             <h3>Showings Go Virtual</h3>
             <p>The rules around in-person showings vary by city, county, and state. Some allow them and some ban them. Check with your state, county, and local government to get the latest on business closures and shut-down rules.</p>
             <p>Agents have conducted home tours via FaceTime and other similar tools for years. But these platforms have proven invaluable for home buying and selling during the pandemic. Real estate sites report a surge in the creation of 3D home tours. Redfin, a real estate brokerage, saw a 494% increase in requests for video home tours in March.</p>
             <p>In places where in-person showings are allowed, agents wipe down door handles, spray the lockbox with disinfectant, and open up the house, closets, everything for a client.</p>
             <div class="rightWrap">
                 <img src="../images/blogsingleHouse.jpg" alt="florida home"/>
             </div>
             <h3>Safe-Showing Guidelines</h3>
             <p>The National Association of Realtors®, which produces HouseLogic, recommends only one buyer enter a home at a time, with 6 feet between each guest. NAR also recommends agents have potential buyers wash their hands, or use hand sanitizer when they come in the door. They should also remove their shoes. No children should be present at showings, either.
             <h3>Walk-throughs</h3>
             <p>Home buying and selling during the pandemic means real estate agents can conduct the final walk-through via video with their clients. Or they can just open the home and have buyers walk through on their own.</p>
             <h3>Closings Get Creative</h3>
             <p>Traditional closings, where everybody gathered around a big table to sign the final papers, are no longer possible. Title companies and banks are getting super creative in dealing with the limitations. There are now drive-by closings, where the entire transaction takes place in cars. Masked and gloved notaries meet buyers in parking lots and pass documents through car windows.</p><h3>So, Should You Buy or Sell?</h3>
             <p>The real estate industry is creatively and safely responding to the situation, and mortgage rates remain low. Your agent is a great source of information about home buying and selling during the pandemic to help you feel comfortable. But, ultimately, it's a question only you can answer.</p>
